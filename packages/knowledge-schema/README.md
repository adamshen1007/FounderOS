# Knowledge schema

`@founderos/knowledge-schema` is the runtime-validation and TypeScript contract foundation for KnowledgeOS.

It implements the seven object categories defined by the official specifications:

- General knowledge
- Decisions
- Projects
- Research
- Principles
- Experiments
- Relationships

## Design mapping

Every object carries a shared metadata envelope containing identity, classification, provenance, quality, lifecycle, tags, and relationship references. Object-specific schemas enforce additional requirements such as decision reasoning and review dates or project vision and milestones.

Persistent lifecycle states use `draft`, `review`, `active`, `archived`, and `deprecated`. Creation and modification are represented by `createdAt` and `updatedAt`; they are events, not persistent statuses.

The package intentionally contains no persistence, Markdown parsing, retrieval, embedding, graph database, or agent behavior.

## Usage

```typescript
import { KnowledgeObjectSchema, parseKnowledgeObject } from "@founderos/knowledge-schema";

const result = KnowledgeObjectSchema.safeParse(input);
const knowledgeObject = parseKnowledgeObject(input);
```

All schemas reject unknown fields so contract changes remain explicit and versioned.
